LPC_Speech_Anylisis_MathLab
===========================
On the project I perform analysis on a given speech signal (sx119.pcm speech in raw PCM format, with sampling frequency of 16 kHz, and samples represented as 16-bit integers (shorts). We will perform the analysis according to the given specifications. The analysis was done using MATLAB.
The first question we were asked to perform is LPC Analysis according to the following specifications:
 Window type: Hamming
 Window length (frame length): 20 milliseconds
 LPC analysis step: 5 milliseconds (i.e. 200 Hz analysis rate)
 LPC method: autocorrelation
 LPC prediction order: 16
